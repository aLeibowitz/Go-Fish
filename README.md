# Go-Fish
My first Console App project.
This was an in-class project, aimed at practicing our uses and organizations of different classes, and getting them to interact with each other. 
I learned a lot from this project, specifically with regards to class constructors, polymorphism and synchronous programming.

## Built With

* Visual Studio 2017
* C#
